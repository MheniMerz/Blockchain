The public/private key pair of all users known to the 'currency'
are created by the Python script 'enrol.py', as follows:

$ python enrol.py alice
creates the files: alice.pub and alice.priv, containing the public 
and private key respectively.

You have to manually create the config file 'alice.conf' containing:
pubkey=users/alice.pub
privkey=users/alice.priv

The ubi program generates coins for every user in the 'users' directory,
subject to configuration in ubi.conf.
The coin program running in Autotest mode (./coin Autotest users 8)
generates a round-robin of PayCoins transactions, pairwise among
alice, bob, chaz, dave, ellie, fiona, gary, and helen.

If you want to run a parallel ./coin client, it would be advisable to
create a second users directory (so, users1 and users2), and use
enrol.py to create more users key pairs. For example enrol.py for:
ian, jill, kenji, luna, mheni, nada
If the user directories are completely disjoint, there will be no
mixing of the coinsets between users1 and users2. So it will be useful
to have, for example, gary and helen present in both users and users2
directories.
